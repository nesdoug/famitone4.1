text2vol4, replaces text2data for famitone2
doug fraker, ver 4.2 6-22-2019, unofficial update, nesdoug.com


additions so far:
	-volume column support
	-full note range
	-1xx,2xx,4xx effects
	
version4.1:
	-added command line switch -allin to prevent removing unused instruments
	-added command line switch -Wno to ignore warnings about unsupported effects
	-fixed bug, multiple D00 effects (different channels) incorrect pattern length
	-fixed bug, Bxx below D00 effect (different channels) incorrect pattern length
	-fixed bug, Bxx loop back causing wrong instrument inserted at loop point
example of new switches:
text2vol4 filename.txt -ca65 -allin -Wno	

usage notes:
	-use the "v1.15 by Shiru 04'17" version of nsf2data (included) for sound effects.
	-must use with famitone4 asm files
	-should use with famitracker 0.4.6 (or later) text export
	-use volume column for Square 1, Square 2, and Noise Channels
	-at the start of a song, the volume column is assumed to be 'f'
	-if you loop backwards, use a volume column entry for the first note at the loop point, or else it will carry over whatever volume is still loaded
Example - at the start of the loop, you fail to put a volume column entry, but at the end of the loop, you fade out to zero. When it loops backwards, the volume will still be set to zero.
	-use any note for Square 1 + 2, Triangle, or Noise Channel
	-restrict DPCM to C-1 to D-6
	-pal support has been removed. only the ntsc note table remains.
	(see the PAL folder, where it has been restored)
	-make sure you don't put game variables where the famitone variables are


added features:
	-use the command line -allin to ensure all instruments are output, even if no song uses it. this may come in handy if you have too many songs and need to split the famitracker file into 2 parts.
	-the song titles will appear in comments in the asm data. This may come in handy if you need to cut or move 1 song for space reasons.

***new with version 4 - support for 1xx,2xx,4xx effects. They apply to the Square and Triangle channels. Use 100 or 200 to disable the pitch bend. Use 400 to disable to vibrato. The vibrato speed (4xy where x is speed) is permanently set to 6. I recommend that you write all the vibrato effects like 461 462 463, etc. "a" (like 46a) is the maximum depth. 

You can put a 1xx(2xx) and 4xx effect at the same time on a note, but not on the same line...only 1 fx column is allowed(per channel), so 1xx(2xx) on the first line and 4xx on the line below that.

It's not perfectly the same as famitracker. You might have to make slight adjustments to get it to do what you want.
	
	
comparison:
	-a level of efficiency has been removed to make room for more elements
	-even without volume column, file sizes could be 110-125% of what they would have been in the official famitone2
	-every volume column entry will add another byte
	-every fx change will add another byte
	
	
other notes:
	-i've marked all changes with ** or *** in the files and in the source code
	-i have not modified the licence, which states...
